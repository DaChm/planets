The Xeno that is seen
Is not the true Xeno, until
You purify it with flamethrower.

With searching comes loss
and the presence of absence:
"Chaos" not found.

Yesterday it worked
Today it is not working
killing orcs is like that.

The Emperor protects
The magazine is empty
time to throw some grenades.

One does not know
what it means to be clean
until exposed to 
the flames of the Unclean
